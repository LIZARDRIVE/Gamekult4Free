# Gamekult4Free
A script to obtain codes offering you 3 months of Gamekult premium content for free.


Gamekult offers the possibility to benefit from 3 months subscription for free 
to people who receive a specific code (for instance when buying something from a partner)
Code has to be made of a combination of 6 caps letters and numbers
It can be used on this page https://www.gamekult.com/utilisateur/s-abonner.html

Why did I check this? Because a code I owned was already claimed, even though I never registered it.
Why did I use random instead of autoincrement for code? For fun!

Issue(s) with Gamekult's dev here: 
 - you can spam validation page has much as you want, with nothing but the code in the header
 - validation page tells you expected format for code
